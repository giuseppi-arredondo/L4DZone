            <li>Accept the platform's rules.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have downloaded the custom maps from the "Maps" section.</li>
            <li>Click the "Play Queue" button to join the match queue.</li>
            <li>Once the server's IP is displayed:
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect to the server using the provided IP.</li>
                    <li>Type <code>!ready</code> in the in-game chat to confirm your participation.</li>

        <h2>What happens if I leave a match?</h2>
        <p>
            Leaving a match disrupts the experience for other players and results in temporary penalties. 
            Penalty durations range from 1 hour to 32 days, depending on your recent match history.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If you fail to type <code>!ready</code></strong> or join the server within 5 minutes after the IP is displayed, 
                the match will be canceled, and you will receive a penalty.
            </li>
            <li>After the match starts, the inactivity limits are:
                <ul>
                    <li>5 minutes of total inactivity per match.</li>
                    <li>4 minutes per period of inactivity or disconnection.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first limit reached will be applied.</p>
        
        <h2>How does the MMR system work?</h2>
        <p>
            The MMR (Matchmaking Rating) system is used to balance competitive matches:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gain and Loss:</strong> Winning matches increases your MMR, while losing reduces it.</li>
            <li><strong>Score Influence:</strong> The point difference between teams impacts the amount of MMR gained or lost.</li>
            <li><strong>Visible Ranks:</strong> You must complete at least 10 matches for your rank to become visible.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>L4DZone Servers</h2>
        <p>
            L4DZone operates optimized, proprietary servers to ensure smooth gameplay. Servers are automatically 
            assigned based on your geographic region to prioritize performance.
